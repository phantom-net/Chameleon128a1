# ChameleonMini128a1-revG
Based on the open-source NFC tool ChameleonMini: https://github.com/emsec/ChameleonMini

This implementation of ChameleonMini has been created for hardware board based on
ATxmega128A1 (no USB) and FTDI MM323R. LUFA usb framework is now removed and ftdi library
is included.
